In contrast to the Chemistry Centre, UBC decided to construct a new law building instead of renovating -- each project is evaluated individually to determine what is best environmentally, economically and socially. The Faculty of Law outgrew the old building so now they will enjoy state-of-the-art teaching and research spaces that promote legal discussions and student engagement.",
